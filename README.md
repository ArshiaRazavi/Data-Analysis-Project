This repository is made for final project of Advanced Data Analysis Course intructed by Claudia Gomes da Rocha at The University of Calgary during my M.Sc. program in Fall 2023 semester. 
Goal of the project was to analyze mice visual cortex recordings (2 photon calcium signals with single cell resolution) using data analysis tools taught in the course. Selected datasets are from public Allen Institute Brain Recordings. 

The final report of the project is in the main directory. In order to reproduce the plots and results of the report, run "Explanatory Analysis.ipynb" jupyter notebook in code folder.
Data file contatins datasets for analysis and Code/AllenDriftClasses.py is needed for running "Explanatory Analysis.ipynb".

Enjoy!
